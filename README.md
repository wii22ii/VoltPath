# VoltPath
VoltPath is an innovative project focused on generating energy from vehicle traffic using smart pressure plates embedded in road surfaces, known as piezoelectric plates. These plates convert the pressure from car tires into electricity that can be stored or used instantly to power streetlights, digital signage, or city infrastructure.
